# Snake-Game 

> This project is a classic Snake and Apple game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

> The game logic is implemented using JavaScript to control snake movement and growth. 

> HTML5 Canvas is used to draw the snake, apple, and game board dynamically.

> CSS enhances the visual styling and layout of the game interface.

> The player controls the snake using keyboard arrow keys for directional movement.

> Each time the snake eats an apple, its length increases and the score is updated.

> Collision detection is used to identify wall hits and self-collisions.

> The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.

> The project demonstrates concepts like game loops, timers, and event handling.
